# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Android Benchmark App

This is an auto-generated Android app for running Rust benchmarks on real devices.

## Building

```bash
# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Build release APK (recommended for BrowserStack - ~133MB vs ~544MB debug)
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## BrowserStack Testing

```bash
# Build with mobench (use --release for smaller APK uploads)
cargo mobench build --target android --release

# Run on BrowserStack
cargo mobench run --target android --function my_benchmark \
  --devices "Google Pixel 7-13.0" --release
```

## Running Benchmarks

The app reads benchmark configuration from:
1. Intent extras (`bench_function`, `bench_iterations`, `bench_warmup`)
2. `assets/bench_spec.json`
3. Default values in code

## Benchmark Report Capture

The app captures benchmark results for BrowserStack:
- Displays results on screen for 5 seconds (video capture)
- Outputs JSON with `BENCH_JSON` marker to logcat
